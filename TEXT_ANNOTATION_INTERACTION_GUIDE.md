# Text Annotation Interaction Guide

## ✅ New Interactive Text System

The text annotation tool now follows a **tap-to-select, drag-to-move, tap-again-to-edit** pattern, similar to professional annotation tools like Drawsana.

### How It Works

#### 1. **Create New Text**
- Select the text tool (T icon)
- Tap anywhere on empty space
- A new text annotation appears with default text "Text"
- Automatically enters **selection mode** with blue dotted border

#### 2. **Selection Mode** (First Tap)
When a text annotation is selected, you see:
- **Blue dotted border** around the text
- **Red delete button** (top-left corner) - tap to remove
- **Blue resize handle** (bottom-right corner) - drag to change font size

Actions available:
- **Drag the text** anywhere on the photo to reposition it
- **Drag the resize handle** up/down to increase/decrease font size (12pt - 72pt)
- **Tap delete button** to remove the annotation
- **Tap the text again** to enter edit mode

#### 3. **Edit Mode** (Second Tap)
When you tap selected text again:
- Text field appears with current text
- Keyboard automatically appears (with 0.3s delay)
- Edit the text content
- Two buttons appear:
  - **Cancel** - exit edit mode without saving
  - **Done** - save changes and return to selection mode

#### 4. **Drag to Move**
- When text is selected (blue border visible)
- Simply drag it to a new location
- Position updates in real-time

#### 5. **Resize with Handle**
- Drag the blue circle (bottom-right corner)
- Drag down = increase font size
- Drag up = decrease font size
- Range: 12pt to 72pt

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `selectedTextAnnotationIndex` - Currently selected text (shows handles)
- `editingTextAnnotationIndex` - Currently being edited (shows text field)
- Tap once: Select (set selectedTextAnnotationIndex)
- Tap twice: Edit (set editingTextAnnotationIndex)

### Coordinate System
- Text stored in image coordinates
- Handles rendered in screen coordinates
- Automatic scaling handles different image sizes

### Gesture Handling
- Tap without movement (< 10px) = Selection/Edit toggle
- Drag with movement (>= 10px) = Move text position
- Drag resize handle = Adjust font size

## User Experience Flow

```
Empty Space Tap
    ↓
Create "Text" annotation → Selection Mode
    ↓
[SELECTED STATE]
├─ Drag → Move text
├─ Drag resize handle → Change size
├─ Tap delete → Remove
└─ Tap text → Edit Mode
       ↓
   [EDITING STATE]
   ├─ Type new text
   ├─ Cancel → Deselect
   └─ Done → Back to Selected
```

## Removed Features
- ❌ Fixed bottom editor bar (was off-screen)
- ❌ Separate font size slider (now use resize handle)
- ❌ Scale and rotation bindings (not implemented yet)
- ❌ All debug logging (cleaned up)

## Files Modified
- `PhotoAnnotationEditor.swift` - Main photo editor
- `QuotePhotoAnnotationEditor.swift` - Quote photo editor
- Removed `InlineTextEditorView` component (replaced with simple overlay)

## Known Limitations
1. Font size only changes via drag handle (no slider)
2. No rotation support yet
3. Text bounds are approximate (character count × font size)
4. Resize handle is small (20px circle)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Rotation gestures
- [ ] More precise text bounds calculation
- [ ] Pinch to resize
- [ ] Font family selection
- [ ] Text color picker
- [ ] Multiple line support improvements
