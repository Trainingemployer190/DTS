# DTS App - Beta Release Notes

## Beta 2 (v1.0.1 Build 2) - December 2024

### üîß Critical Fixes

- **Fixed Pricing Calculation Discrepancy**: Resolved issue where Jobber quotes showed $200+ less than app calculations
  - Root cause: API was sending base costs instead of final marked-up prices
  - Solution: Implemented proportional price distribution logic to maintain accurate pricing ratios
  - Impact: Jobber quotes now match app calculations exactly (e.g., $624.02 total now correctly reflected in Jobber)

- **Fixed Settings Not Applied to New Quotes**: Profit margin % and markup % now correctly use current app settings
  - Root cause: QuoteDraft model was using hardcoded default values instead of user settings
  - Solution: Updated initialization logic to apply current AppSettings values
  - Impact: New quotes automatically use configured profit margins and markup percentages

### üéØ Technical Improvements

- Enhanced API integration with comprehensive debug logging for price verification
- Improved quote initialization workflow for better user experience
- Added robust error handling for Jobber API communication

### üì± User Experience
