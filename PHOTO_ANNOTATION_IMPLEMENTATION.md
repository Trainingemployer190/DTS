## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence
- **SwiftData** for database (`PhotoRecord` @Model)
- **Local file storage** for images (Documents directory)
- **Codable annotations** stored in PhotoRecord
- **Automatic migration** - existing photos compatible

### Photo Capture Integration
- Reuses existing `PhotoCaptureManager`
- GPS location from continuous tracking
- Watermarking with location text
- Compatible with existing quote photo system

### Annotation Storage
```swift
struct PhotoAnnotation: Codable {
    var id: UUID
    var type: AnnotationType  // freehand, arrow, box, circle, text
    var points: [CGPoint]     // Drawing points
    var text: String?         // For text annotations
    var color: String         // Hex color code
    var position: CGPoint     // Anchor point
    var size: CGFloat         // Stroke width/text size
}
```

Annotations are:
- ✅ **Non-destructive** - Original photo unchanged
- ✅ **Editable** - Can undo/redo
- ✅ **Persistent** - Saved with photo in database
- ✅ **Portable** - Export with annotations rendered
