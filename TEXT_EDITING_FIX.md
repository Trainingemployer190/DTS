# Text Editing Fix - Now Editable!

## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Text field appeared but couldn't be edited.

**Root Cause:**
1. TextField was constrained inside a fixed-size frame with ZStack overlay
2. Control buttons were overlapping the text input area
3. Focus delay wasn't long enough for view to render

## Changes Made

### New Layout Structure
```
VStack (not ZStack!)
├── Control Buttons Row (Delete | Spacer | Done)
├── TextField (dedicated space, no overlap)
└── Font Size Controls (slider with label)
```

### Key Improvements

1. **✅ TextField Now Has Dedicated Space**
   - Removed ZStack overlap
   - `minWidth: 280, minHeight: 60` ensures room for typing
   - No competing gestures from overlays

2. **✅ Increased Focus Delay**
   ```swift
   DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.3) {
       isTextFieldFocused = true
   }
   ```
   - Changed from instant to 0.3 seconds
   - Allows view layout to complete first

3. **✅ Better Visual Design**
   - Buttons now 36x36pt (more touchable)
   - TextField has 12pt padding (more room)
   - Black background at 0.85 opacity (more readable)
   - Blue stroke is 2pt thick (clearer selection)

4. **✅ Improved Font Controls**
   - Shows "Font Size" label and value side-by-side
   - "72pt" format instead of just "72"
   - Blue tint on slider for consistency

## How to Test

1. **Run the app** on iPhone 16 Pro simulator
2. **Open any photo** (job photo or quote photo)
3. **Tap the text tool** (T icon in right toolbar)
4. **Tap on the photo** where you want text
5. **You should see:**
   - Inline editor appears at tap location
   - Keyboard pops up automatically
   - "Tap to edit" text is pre-selected
   - You can immediately start typing

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard appears automatically
- [ ] Can type and edit text
- [ ] Can delete text with keyboard
- [ ] Can select/highlight text
- [ ] Font size slider changes text size live
- [ ] Delete button removes the text annotation
- [ ] Done button saves and closes editor
- [ ] Text appears on photo after saving

## What Should Happen

### Tap Sequence:
1. **Tap text tool** → Tool becomes selected (blue background)
2. **Tap photo** → Inline editor appears with keyboard
3. **Start typing** → "Tap to edit" gets replaced
4. **Adjust font** → Drag slider, text resizes live
5. **Tap Done** → Editor closes, text stays on photo
6. **Tap undo** → Text removed (if implemented)

### Alternative: Delete
- **Tap Delete button** → Text removed immediately

## Troubleshooting

### If Keyboard Doesn't Appear:
- Check iOS Simulator keyboard settings
- Menu: I/O → Keyboard → Toggle Software Keyboard
- Or press: `⌘K` to show keyboard

### If Text Field Not Responding:
- Make sure you're tapping inside the black text box
- The blue border shows it's focused
- Try tapping directly on the "Enter text" placeholder

### If Editor Appears Off-Screen:
- This is a coordinate conversion issue
- Try tapping near center of photo first
- Future fix: Clamp position to visible bounds

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Based on Drawsana patterns, these could be added:

1. **Drag to Reposition**
   - Add drag gesture to VStack
   - Update `annotation.position` during drag

2. **Tap to Re-Edit**
   - Detect tap on existing text annotation
   - Show editor again for that text

3. **Auto-dismiss on Tap Away**
   - Detect taps outside editor bounds
   - Automatically call `onDone()`

4. **Rotation/Scale Handles**
   - Add pinch gesture for scale
   - Add rotation gesture
   - Small circular handles like Drawsana

## Technical Notes

### Why VStack Instead of ZStack?
- ZStack overlays elements → gesture conflicts
- VStack stacks elements → clear hit testing
- Each element has its own interaction zone

### Why Longer Focus Delay?
- SwiftUI needs time to:
  1. Calculate layout
  2. Position view
  3. Render TextField
  4. Attach focus state
- 0.3s ensures all steps complete

### Coordinate Conversion
```swift
func convertToScreenCoordinates(_ point: CGPoint) -> CGPoint {
    let scaleFactor = imageSize.width / containerSize.width
    let xOffset = (containerSize.width - imageSize.width) / 2
    let yOffset = (containerSize.height - imageSize.height) / 2

    return CGPoint(
        x: point.x / scaleFactor + xOffset,
        y: point.y / scaleFactor + yOffset
    )
}
```
Converts from image coordinates (where annotation lives) to screen coordinates (where editor displays).
