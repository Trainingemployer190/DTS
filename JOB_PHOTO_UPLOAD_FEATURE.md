# Job Photo Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated the job details section to provide two options for photo capture ("Take Photo" and "Choose from Library"), with automatic upload to Jobber as notes - matching the functionality in the quotes section.

## Changes Made

### 1. JobberAPI.swift - Added Job Note Creation
**Location**: `/DTS App/DTS App/Managers/JobberAPI.swift`

#### New Types Added:
```swift
// Job Note Creation Types
struct JobCreateNoteInput {
    let message: String
    let attachments: [NoteAttachmentAttributes]?
}

struct JobNote: Codable {
    let id: String
    let message: String
    let createdAt: String
}

struct JobCreateNoteResponse {
    let jobNote: JobNote?
    let userErrors: [GraphQLError]
}
```

#### New Functions:
- `submitPhotosAsJobNote()` - Main function to upload photos as a job note
  - Uploads photos to imgbb
  - Creates a job note with photo attachments
  - Returns success/failure result

- `createJobNote()` - GraphQL mutation wrapper
  - Calls Jobber's `jobCreateNote` mutation
  - Handles response and errors

### 2. JobViews.swift - Updated Job Detail UI
**Location**: `/DTS App/DTS App/Views/JobViews.swift`

#### JobDetailView Updates:
- Added `@EnvironmentObject var jobberAPI: JobberAPI` for API access
- Added state variables for upload tracking:
  - `isUploadingToJobber` - Shows upload progress
  - `uploadError` - Stores error messages
  - `showingUploadSuccess` - Shows success alert
  - `showingPhotoMenu` - Controls photo menu display

- Added `uploadPhotosToJobber()` function:
  - Filters photos for the current job
  - Calls `submitPhotosAsJobNote()` API
  - Shows success/error alerts with haptic feedback

- Auto-upload integration:
  - Photos automatically upload after capture from camera
  - Photos automatically upload after selection from library

#### New Component: PhotoMenuButton
Replaced the old `CameraButton` with a new menu-based button:
- **Menu Options**:
  - "Take Photo" - Opens camera
  - "Choose from Library" - Opens photo picker
- **Visual Features**:
  - Shows progress indicator during upload
  - Changes text to "Uploading Photos..." during upload
  - Disabled state during upload
  - Gradient background with blue theme
  - Dropdown chevron icon

#### ActionButtonsSection Updates:
- Added `showingPhotoMenu` binding
- Added `isUploadingToJobber` parameter
- Replaced `CameraButton` with `PhotoMenuButton`

### 3. DataModels.swift - Updated CapturedPhoto Model
**Location**: `/DTS App/DTS App/Models/DataModels.swift`

```swift
struct CapturedPhoto: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let image: UIImage
    let timestamp: Date
    let location: String?
    let quoteDraftId: UUID?
    let jobId: String?  // ‚Üê NEW: Track which job the photo belongs to

    init(image: UIImage, location: String? = nil, quoteDraftId: UUID? = nil, jobId: String? = nil)
}
```

### 4. PhotoCaptureManager.swift - Updated Image Processing
**Location**: `/DTS App/DTS App/Managers/PhotoCaptureManager.swift`

Updated `processImage()` to include jobId when creating CapturedPhoto:
```swift
let capturedPhoto = CapturedPhoto(
    image: uiImage,
    location: locationString,
    quoteDraftId: quoteDraftId,
    jobId: jobId  // ‚Üê NEW: Pass jobId to track photos
)
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Navigate to Job Details** - User clicks on a job from the home tab
2. **Open Photo Menu** - User taps the "Capture Photo" button (now a menu)
3. **Choose Option**:
   - **Take Photo**: Opens camera to capture new photo
   - **Choose from Library**: Opens photo picker to select existing photo
4. **Photo Processing**:
   - Photo is watermarked with timestamp and location
   - Photo is saved locally
   - Photo is tracked with jobId
5. **Auto-Upload**:
   - After photo capture/selection, upload automatically starts
   - Upload indicator shows "Uploading Photos..."
   - Photos are uploaded to imgbb
   - Job note is created in Jobber with photo attachments
6. **Confirmation**:
   - Success: Shows alert "Photos have been uploaded to Jobber as a note"
   - Error: Shows alert with error message
   - Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation

### Technical Flow:
```
User taps menu ‚Üí Select option ‚Üí Capture/Select photo
    ‚Üì
PhotoCaptureManager.processImage()
    ‚Üì
Photo saved with jobId
    ‚Üì
JobDetailView.uploadPhotosToJobber()
    ‚Üì
Filter photos by jobId
    ‚Üì
JobberAPI.submitPhotosAsJobNote()
    ‚Üì
Upload to imgbb ‚Üí Create job note ‚Üí Return result
    ‚Üì
Show success/error alert
```

## API Integration

### Jobber GraphQL Mutation Used:
```graphql

  jobCreateNote(jobId: $jobId, input: $input) {
    jobNote {
      id
      message
      createdAt
    }
    userErrors {

      path
    }
  }
}
```

### Note Message Format:

"Photos uploaded from DTS App on Oct 4, 2025 at 3:23 PM"
```

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
