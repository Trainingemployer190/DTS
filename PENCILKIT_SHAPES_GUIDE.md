# Enhanced PencilKit with Shape Tools

## 🎉 What's New

I've enhanced the PencilKit editor to replicate the **Apple Photos markup experience** with one-click shape tools!

## 📱 How to Use

### Opening the Editor
1. Go to **Photo Library** (4th tab)
2. Tap any photo
3. Tap the **"PencilKit"** button (green, middle button)

### New Features - Vertical Toolbar (Right Side)

You'll now see **5 shape buttons** on the right side of the screen:

```

### PencilKit Tools (Bottom Toolbar)

You also still have access to PencilKit's native tools:
- **Pen** - Smooth drawing
- **Pencil** - Sketchy drawing
- **Marker** - Thick highlighting
- **Eraser** - Remove strokes
- **Lasso** - Select, move, resize shapes

1. Tap **Arrow** button → Arrow appears
2. Use **Lasso** tool to drag arrow to damage location
3. Tap **Text** button → Add label "Needs repair"
4. Use **Pen** tool to circle the damage area
5. Tap **Done** → Saves everything

## 🎨 Shape Colors

- **Arrow**: Red (easy to see for important markers)
- **Box**: Green (good for highlighting areas)
- **Circle**: Blue (stands out for specific points)
- **Line**: Orange (visible for measurements)
- **Custom colors**: Use PencilKit's color picker for freehand drawing

## ✨ Key Features

### One-Click Shapes ✅
Unlike pure PencilKit, you now have instant shapes:
- No need to draw arrows by hand

All shapes can be adjusted:
1. Select **Lasso tool** from bottom toolbar
2. Draw around the shape you want to move
3. Drag to reposition
4. Pinch to resize
5. Rotate by twisting

### Combined with Drawing ✅
Best of both worlds:
- Use shape buttons for structured annotations (arrows, boxes)
- Use pen/pencil for freehand drawing
