# Location Tagging Fix Summary

## Issue
The location tagging in photos was stuck on "Getting location..." and never resolved to an actual address or coordinates.

## Root Cause
The app was only requesting location when the photo capture started, using `requestLocation()` which is a one-time request. By the time the photo was taken and processed, the location hadn't been received yet from the system.

## Changes Made to `PhotoCaptureManager.swift`

### 1. **Start Continuous Location Updates**
   - Changed from one-time `requestLocation()` to continuous `startUpdatingLocation()`
   - Added `distanceFilter` of 50 meters to balance accuracy and battery life
   - Location updates now start immediately when location permission is granted

### 2. **Location Manager Setup**
   ```swift
   private func setupLocationManager() {
       locationManager.delegate = self
       locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
       locationManager.distanceFilter = 50 // Update every 50 meters
       // Start location updates when authorized
       if cachedAuthorizationStatus == .authorizedWhenInUse ||
          cachedAuthorizationStatus == .authorizedAlways {
           locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Auto-Start Location Updates on Authorization**
   - When location permission is granted, location updates start automatically
   - This ensures location is available before the user takes photos

### 4. **Stop Location Updates When Not Needed**
   - Added cleanup in `deinit` to stop location updates when the manager is deallocated
   - Stop updates when location permission is denied or restricted
   - Helps conserve battery life

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better filtering of "Getting location..." messages in error handling
   - Clearer distinction between temporary "getting location" state and actual errors

## How It Works Now

1. **App Launch**: When the app starts and location permission is granted, location updates begin immediately
2. **Background Updates**: The location manager continuously monitors location in the background (with 50m filter to save battery)
3. **Photo Capture**: When you take a photo, the current location is immediately available (no waiting)
4. **Watermark**: Photos are watermarked with the current address (if geocoded) or coordinates

## Benefits

- ✅ **Instant Location**: Location is ready when you take photos
- ✅ **Better Accuracy**: Continuous updates provide more accurate location data
- ✅ **Battery Efficient**: 50-meter distance filter prevents excessive updates
- ✅ **Reliable**: Location is pre-loaded rather than requested on-demand

## Testing Notes

- Test on a real device for best results (simulator has limited location features)
- The first location fix may take a few seconds after granting permission
- Location accuracy improves over time as GPS signal stabilizes
- In the simulator, you can set a custom location via: Features → Location → Custom Location

## Next Steps

If you're testing on a real device:
1. Make sure Location Services are enabled in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services
2. Ensure the app has "While Using" permission
3. Take some test photos to verify location is being captured correctly
4. Check that the watermark shows the correct location information
